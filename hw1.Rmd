## Tidyverse and ggplot2
  * In this chapter we will learn how to visualize data using ggplot2, a part of the tidyverse.
  * install tidyverse, if you have not:
  ```{r}
  install.packages("tidyverse", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
  ```
  * After installation, load tidyverse by
  ```{r}
  library(tidyverse)
  ```
